# Quickstart:

0) Edit the main configuration: 

[saintb-config.edn.example](saintb-config.edn.example)

The config example is well documented with all the informations.
For more details look at specifications, below.


1) Startup the daemon with:

`java -jar saint-build-VERSION-standalone.jar`

___
# specification:

Below some minimal description of `saintb-config.edn` file

1) Add the Jenkins credentials

```
;; JENKINS configuration
{
  :config {
   :username "my-jenkins-user" 
   :password "my-jenkins-pwd"
   :jenkins-url "https://my-jenkins-server.com/"
 }
```
___

2)  Select the jobs you want to monitor/perform actions:

Add your jobs in the `list` parameter

```
  :jobs {
     :list ["magic-job1", "my-good-job2"]
     :actions {
                 :buildstatus true
              }
    }
```

* actions:

Currently we support only `buildstatus` set to true

`buildstatus` true, will select for each job in the list the latestBuild failed, latest build OK, and other usefull informations;

It returns a map like this

```
{:lastCompletedBuild "https://jenkins.com/job/my-job-magic/175/", :healtReport "Build stability: All recent builds failed.", :lastFailedBuild "https://ci.jenkins.com/job/my-job-magic/175/", :lastStableBuild "https://ci.jenkins.com/job/my-job-magic/152/"} 
```

This map/data will then sent via notificationschannel
___
3) Notifications medium

If you add multiples medium in the notifications, the data will sent too all this channels.

We support currently only rocketchat, but other medium can be added easy.

```
 :notifications {
   ;; ** SUPPORTED **
   ;; one can specify a list of mediums where the same message will send
   ;; configuration for rocketchat
   :rocketchat {
                  :username "myuser"
                  :server-url "https://my-rocketchat-server.com"
                  :token "my-magic-token"
                  ;; it must be a public channel. A list of public rocketchat channels
                  :channel-names ["clojure"]
                  ;; this is a message prefix before the data, customize it as you wish
                  :msg-prefix ":doge: :doge: :doge:" ;; some emoticons
               }

   ;; **  NOT SUPPORTED, yet **
   ;;
   ;; some possible candidates..
   ;; :slack {:configuration  bla bla}
   ;; :mail {:configuration}
  }

```


# Features:

-  Monitor the build status of a given list of jobs, and send them via a medium or multiples of choice


# Constraints
